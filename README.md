About Us
Page 1: Inventory Page The inventory page shows the summary data (food wasted) and a list of inventory on the user's fridge in a table form. The table is linked to a google sheet where the google sheet saved all the food content. The google sheet have an extentsion called apps script. In the apps script, a code file named code.gs have a unquie URL (inventory.html, line 272) which enable google sheet to update from Jarvis and to display at Jarvis Website. User able to search the specific food, sort the items as long as the website is connect to the internent.

Note that the Summary sentence takes a few seconds to load.

Page 2: Summary Summary page shows the summary daya (food wasted) and all the foods or items that are already expired in terms of last 7 days (Weekly Waste Report) and last 30 days (Monthly Waste Report) in the form of tables. The count is based on the food quantity e.g 2 apples and 1 milk expired 3 days ago and 34 days ago: 2 foods wasted last 7 days and 3 foods wasted last 30 days.

The following shows the typical shelf life that Jarvis can understand. (In Terms of Days)

SHELF_LIFE_RULES = { "protein": 4, "seafood": 7, "dairy": 10, "vegetables": 7, "fruits": 7, "grains": 14,
"pantry": 365, "processed": 7, "non-food": 0 }

Note that the Summary sentence takes a few seconds to load.

Page 3: Guide Guide page shows the system overview, hardware & interaction guide and website navigation guide to the user so that he or she can use it seamlessly.
